	"bio": "I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto, in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science. I am also a faculty member at the Vector Institute where I hold a Canada CIFAR AI Chair, and a faculty affiliate at the Schwartz Reisman Institute. In 2022, I was named an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow in Computer Science.<br /><br />My research interests are at the intersection of security, privacy, and machine learning. If you would like to learn more about my research, I recommend reading the blog posts I co-authored on cleverhans.io, for example about proof-of-learning, collaborative learning beyond federation, dataset inference, machine unlearning, differentially private ML, or adversarial examples.<br /><br />My research has been cited in the press, including the New York Times, Popular Science, and Wired. I currently serve as a Program Committee Chair of the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML), an Associate Chair of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&amp;P), and an Area Chair of NeurIPS. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, working with Prof. Patrick McDaniel and supported by a Google PhD Fellowship. Upon graduating, I spent a year at Google Brain where I still spend some of my time.<br /><br />Media availability: TV, Radio, Print/Online",
